            <h2>How Does Coding Work?</h2>
            Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical
            or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions.
            Computer coding functions much like a manual. A programmer or developer
            writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to
            create a visual or to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded
            manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a
            successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of
            text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions
            included in the coded manual. Users interact with websites and apps with
            the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show up
            on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a developer or
            programmer asks the computer to display. Coding tells a machine which
            actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages
            provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based
            technologies. Each programming language helps humans accurately
            communicate with machines.

            <h4>Types of Programming Languages</h4>
            Binary code comprises a series of zeros and ones, used to communicate
            instructions. This code is a low-level programming language. Each digit
            in a coded sequence connects to a switch in your computer. Each switch
            connects to an action, and together thousands of switches operate a
            device. High-level code, a computer communication process that works
            much like human language, allows programmers to operate entire systems
            simultaneously. High-level programming languages convert human language
            from programmers into binary code that computers understand.

            <h4>What Is Coding Used For?</h4>

            Developers use a variety of programming languages to build websites and
            applications. Front-end developers typically use HTML, CSS, or
            JavaScript code to create website layouts and design functions. Websites
            with user accounts, like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn, require
            back-end developers to write computer code that connects websites to
            databases. Back-end developers often write code using languages such as
            SQL, Java, and Python. Developers use other languages like Python,
            Objective-C, C#, Swift, or Ruby on Rails to create apps for cell phones
            and computer software. Below, we list popular programming languages and
            their most common uses.

            <h4>Careers in Coding</h4>
            From 2021-2031, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a much-faster-than-average growth rate for software
            and web development jobs. Securing these jobs means having a solid foundation in coding. These skills
            enhance your portfolio for careers in and outside the tech industry.

            Jobs in computer science significantly benefit from coding skills. Career options that use coding include
            web developers, software engineers, and game developers. After attending a bootcamp, you can gain experience
            in junior-level positions before advancing into higher-level roles.
