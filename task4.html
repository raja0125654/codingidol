                A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was an Indian scientist and politician who played a
                leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons
                programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. He planned a
                program that produced a number of successful missiles, helping earn
                him the nickname “Missile Man.” Beginning in the early 1990s, he also
                served as scientific adviser to the government, and his prominent role
                in India’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests established Kalam as a national
                hero. In 2002 the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) National Democratic
                Alliance nominated Kalam, a Muslim, to succeed outgoing President K.R.
                Narayanan. Kalam easily won the elections in 2002, and in the largely
                ceremonial post he sought to use science and technology to transform
                India into a developed country. In 2007 he was succeeded by Pratibha
                Patil, the country’s first woman president.
                From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role
                in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as
                a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam
                put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for
                transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic
                growth, and widening access to health care and education.

                Signature of Gandhi Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869
                – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and
                political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
                successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He
                inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The
                honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first
                applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the
                world. Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi
                trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the
                bar at age 22 in June 1891.
